# FetchInterviewApplication
This is an application for the interview process with [Fetch rewards](https://www.fetchrewards.com/).  It is based off the requirements found [here.](https://fetch-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/mobile.html)

It is fairly simple to try and timebox the process and show more a technical set of skills.  It consists of a tablayout with 4 sections to refer to the 4 different `listId`'s which will display the expected items returned from the json for that `listId`. 

# Future Improvements
Going forward, the first couple of improvements I would make would be the following
- Implement testing around adapters
- Make TabLayout generate tabs from the count of how many `listId`'s there are in order to make it future proof
- Style it out more and spend some time cleaning up auto generated UI components
- Introduce on click of cards to edit the different items in the list
